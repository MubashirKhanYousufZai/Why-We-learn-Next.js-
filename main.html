    <h3>1. File Based Routing:</h3>
    <p3>In React we need to install third party routing packages, configuration and add code.<br/>
    But Next.js provide file based routing which make this process easier for us.</p3>
    <h4>2. Pre-Rendering:</h4>
    <p4>Next.js genrates HTML for each page in advance Instead of Client Side Java Script.<br/>
    & This improves the SEO that helps us our website to hit the GOOGLE's SEO.</p4>
    <h5>3. API-Routes:</h5> 
    <p5>We can create API routes by using next.js. So next.js is a ful stack framework<br/>
    If you think about it we can write the frontend code in react but also write api's that can called by the react app.</p5>
    <h6>4. Support for CSS modules:</h6> 
    <p6>Next.js supports CSS modules which saves the time of choosing css library.<br/>
    Offcourse we are allowed to use the css framework like <big>Tailwind</big> or even a CSS<br/>
    in js library like style components for example but Next.js supports Css modules out of the box.<br/></p6>
    <h7>5. Authentication(AUTH):<br/></h7>
    <p7>Next.js supports multiple authenticaion pattrens each designed for different use cases.<br/></p7>
    <h8>6. Dev and Prod build system:<br/></h8>    
    <p8>Next.js gives dev and build system and a well optmised production system.<br/>
    so that we can concentrate on our code more than the configuration.<br/>
    It is a culimination of these features which make next.js an amazing framework to work.</p8>
